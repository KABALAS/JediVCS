FreeVCS/JediVCS - Source Credits file                            V1.0 2003/02/09
********************************************************************************
Hello all,

for a long time I had no plans about opening this source, so nearly all credits
were placed in the online help files or at my web page (htpp://www.freevcs.de)
instead of the source files. I hope this is ok for you...

If anyone feels overlooked, annoyed or misses a hint in one of the source files,
please contact me via the address below and we will correct this immediately.

Thanks to all who contributed these code parts for free to the developers
community,
                                     Thomas Hensle (freevcs@thensle.de) Jan/2003
